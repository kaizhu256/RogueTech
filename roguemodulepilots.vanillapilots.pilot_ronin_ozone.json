        "Details": "Einar Aliyev's bad luck started by being born on Panzyr, where a piece of space debris fell out of the sky and almost crushed the hospital. The only reason he survived his first day was due to the ancient BattleMech torso nearby where a decrepit old MechWarrior was enjoying his lunch. The old-timer saw the falling junk, fired up the 'Mech's lasers and blew it out of the sky. (This was, in fact, the old-timer's job, because stuff fell on Panzyr about every week around the time Einar was born.)\r\n\r\nThis pretty much set the tone for Einar's childhood. Something awful would happen to him as he was doing perfectly ordinary things like climbing on an overgrown spaceship wreck, and yet somehow, he'd survive. Barely. And then he'd get lectured on how he wasn't being careful enough.\r\n\r\nSo Einar grew up to be very, very careful indeed. And, as soon as he could, he left Panzyr, before something happened to make it impossible rather than merely very difficult. He had the fond but relieved farewells of his entire township, who rather hoped some of Panzyr's bad luck would go with him.\r\n\r\nIf it has, it's mostly been turned toward his enemies. He's a very competent MechWarrior, and well-liked among his peers. Nobody believes stories of his jinx, which is nice compared to back home. But he tries to not stay with any one company for long, all the same.",
