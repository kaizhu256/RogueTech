Way he tells it, he's been a tech all his life, fixing everything from toasters to dropships. His credentials are surprisingly stark though, even given his savant-like ability with fiddly mechanical and electrical things. Snooping around the MRB database doesn't help either. He comes highly recommended though, so if he's for hire, his dossier advises signing him depsite his age. He's also a passable Battlemech pilot, so when he's not covered in actuator grease he can throw plenty of firepower downrange if that's what you need from him. He takes no offense from his callsign, laughing that he enjoys showing the 'whippersnappers' what's what in the garage as well as on the field.",
