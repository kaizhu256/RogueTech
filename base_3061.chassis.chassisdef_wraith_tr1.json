It is built around a massive LTV 385 XL Engine that allows it to reach speeds of just under 119 kph. The Wraith has a simple, yet effective, pulse weapons payload. Pulse laser weaponry allows the Mech to negate most of the side effects on accuracy that are introduced by the Wraith's heavy use of jump jets, making it incredibly accurate and powerful for such a lightly armed Mech.",
