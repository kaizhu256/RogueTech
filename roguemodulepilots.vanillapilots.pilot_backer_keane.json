        "Details": "Victoria Samson was born on Thule, in the Draconis Combine. The only daughter of a long line of infantry officers, she had a number of brothers, all of whom adored her. While her parents pushed her toward the traditional occupations of a Draconian girl, her brothers encouraged her in both mischief and combat training.\r\n\r\nIt was inevitable that as soon as she was of age, she enlisted. While she quickly proved her worth as an exceptional 'Mech pilot, her taste for mischief could not be satisfied so easily. She began dabbling in the barracks black market. During her first tour of duty, she piloted her Jenner with distinction - and ran the odd illegal substance along the way.\r\n\r\nOn her next tour, without any combat action, she started cozying up to the Yakuza. This, however, was not as much fun as she'd hoped, and soon she found herself looking for an escape from water that had gotten much too hot. With the aid of some Davion connections she'd made, she fled the Combine and headed straight to the Periphery. Now she hires herself out as a mercenary - and if she makes a little on the side moving things from here to there, well, it makes people happy. And isn't that what counts?",
