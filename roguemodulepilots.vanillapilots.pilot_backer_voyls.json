        "Details": "The son of a Free Worlds League blue collar family with ambitions, Griffin Voyls was an easy-going child who nonetheless always knew his own mind. Although his family encouraged him to enlist or attend a military academy, he chose to go to a technical school because he was pretty sure the discipline of a military enlistment wouldn't suit him.\r\n\r\nHowever, in his last year of school, the military made a serious attempt to recruit him, promising him a position to suit his tastes. He decided to give it a try and accepted a position as a crew member on a military DropShip. Unfortunately, while the discipline and work suited his tastes, DropShip life turned out to be far too close to the front lines for his low-key personality.\r\n\r\nHe returned to civilian work, doing technical work on industrial 'Mechs. But the war found him again. As he looked at the battlefield his work site had turned into, he realized the only way to manage in the world now was to stay moving, and his preferred way to do that was in a mercenary company. If sometimes he serves as a pilot, well, at least there's a whole bunch of metal armor between him and the enemies trying to kill him.",
