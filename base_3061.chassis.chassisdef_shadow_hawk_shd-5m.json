The chassis has been upgraded to an Earthwerks SHD II Endo Steel frame, an additional ton of armor was added, two additional jump jets were fitted for a total jumping distance of 150 meters, the engine replaced with an extralight version of the Hermes 275, and the weapons load has undergone an almost complete renovation. The original autocannon has been updated to an Imperator Ultra Autocannon/5, the LRM launcher to a Doombud LRM-20, and the head-mounted SRM launcher to a Hovertec Streak SRM-2. The amount of ammunition carried and the left-arm medium laser are maintained, and while the number of heat sinks was reduced to ten these were upgrade to double-strength models.",
