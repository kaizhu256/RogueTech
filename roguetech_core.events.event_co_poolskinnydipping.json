Seven wet, naked bodies come flying out of the new Low-G pool installation and into the hall: four women, three men, all laughing and bouncing off each other.\r\n\r\n\"Well, this is way more nudity than I was prepared to see this morning,\" Sumire says.\r\n\r\nYang laughs, \"Seriously! How I am supposed to work with those people now?\"\r\n\r\nAt this point, Sumire begins cracking up. \"Too true.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Murad is still deadly serious. \"Well, Commander? What are we going to do about this?\"",
