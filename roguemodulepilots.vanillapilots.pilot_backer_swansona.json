There was a war out there, and he was far too young to appreciate how it had barely touched his home. When he was old enough, he enlisted and opted for off-planet service.\r\n\r\nBy the end of his first tour, he'd realized that while he enjoyed working in a BattleMech unit, he disliked the discipline of military life. He mustered out and went to Solaris VII, where he spent ten years working his way up through a stable, starting out as a pilot and eventually becoming a coach and manager. But he spent many seasons falling short of his tournament ambitions. Noting the exodus of several up and coming young stars from Solaris VII, he came up with a plan to travel the Periphery, recruiting from among the mercenaries there for a new stable that could could at last win the Grand Tournament.",
