        "Details": "A favourite tool of planetary governments through out the Periphery, the Louse is designed for riot suppression. Capable of dispersing riots with lethal and non lethal options, it works well against civilians and lightly armed vehicles while posing no significant threat to actual battlemechs or military grade vehicles. Dual grenade launchers and a mixed laser package provide the bulk of the firepower, whilst a pair of flare launchers provides additional deterrent and can be used defensively in combat. Spall lined armour provides additional protection against infantry grade weapons and a set of sensors designed specifically for peering through cluttered urban environments round out the package. Often deployed as scouts and support forces; this mech is a common sight amongst the pirate bands who find themselves facing it across the battlefield. Not designed for battle, it is nonetheless pressed into service by desperate militias and governments that lack real battlemechs.",
