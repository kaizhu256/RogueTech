        "Details": "Born and raised on Mechdur, Anja Bray was orphaned early in a vehicle accident. She spent part of her childhood in a group home before being fostered with a family of small business owners and philanthropists. They saw that she received a good education, and after, that she had a place in their enterprise.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, although she tried very hard to impress her benefactors, she was incurably honest. Not just honest, but <i>truthful</i>, in a way that embarrassed even customers of the business. Her family-turned-employers took her off the sales floor. <i>Nobody</i> wanted her on the admin level, so they sent her back to school for an advanced degree. They intended, eventually, to put her in an advisory position, but their kind intentions were derailed by happenstance. One day, while she was on a field trip, her convoy was attacked by one mercenary company, and rescued by another. During the battle, Anja found herself in a pilotless 'Mech and discovered that the same trait that made her unable to resist describing the problems with products also gave her a keen eye for picking out the perfect shots from a 'Mech cockpit.\r\n\r\nWell, it wasn't what her foster family wanted for their Anja, but they were too much the businesswomen to let an opportunity like that skate by. Soon Anja was working regularly as a convoy guard, which only lasted until she got bored enough to transfer to a mercenary company. Because, as she told her family, if she was going to sit in a 'Mech all day, she at least wanted to see new places. She promised she'd write them. Her letters have all sorts of interesting details, and they always know that if she says she's all right, she's doing just fine.",
