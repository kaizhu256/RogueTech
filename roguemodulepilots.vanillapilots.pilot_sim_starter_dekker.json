There, he did not disappoint his family name and graduated on time. After graduation, by family request, he was assigned as a naval lieutenant aboard a Capellan Confederation DropShip. He served without particular distinction and was eventually transferred to a MechWarrior unit, which suited his abilities much better. After another tour of duty, in which he developed the motto: 'any battle you walk away from is a victory,' he decided he wanted to pursue his own goals, and became a mercenary.",
