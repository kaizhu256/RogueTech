Do you think that the hydroponics garden has what you'd need to recreate the real thing?\"\r\n\r\nYang's face takes on the stony expression that you've come to associate with complicated refit orders. \"From what I've heard, this stuff is basically whale meat, so I'll have to improvise… but yes. Challenge accepted!\"\r\n\r\nBy the end of the week, Yang and his MechTechs had raided the garden and retrofitted a blast furnace into a makeshift grill. Somebody even decorated the mess hall in Triple-F's trademark colors.\r\n\r\nWhile only those who've traveled in Davion space can attest to the accuracy of the burgers, everyone agrees that they're delicious.",
