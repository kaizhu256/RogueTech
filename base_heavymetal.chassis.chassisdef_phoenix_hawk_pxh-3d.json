It was built out of New Avalon by Archenar BattleMechs as one of a slew of redesigns using recovered lostech. The 'Mech utilized Endo Steel construction techniques and a Extra-Light engine to free up weight and space for a number of improvements, particularly its weaponry. The 'Mech carried a pair of ER Large Lasers and a pair of Medium Pulse Lasers split between both arms. With the machine guns and their ammunition removed, this allowed two additional heat sinks to be added, and all single heat sinks were exchanged for double strength models.",
