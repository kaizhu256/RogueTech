A compete overhaul designed to be compatible with the myriad PXH-1 variants found throughout the Periphery, the redesign takes advantage of Lushan Industries production license for the new ER Large Laser. Mounting this in place of the original Large Laser, the weapons increased heat is balanced by the inclusion of 2 extra heat sinks; with an Endo steel chassis providing the necessary free wieght. Retaining the medium lasers and the Guardian ECM suite, the 2L is a cheap upgrade for anyone fielding a PXH-1 design. Available for export throughout the Periphery, the only constraint to production is the lack of a production facility for the PXH chassis, though Alliance Mech Works has plans to build a dedicated PHX line should the design prove popular. Until then the current output is limited to in-situ conversions of existing mechs and the restoration of battlefield salvage. ",
