Built around 18 Double Heat Sinks, the 4S has similar design principles to it’s predecessor; designed for ease of maintenance and repair. With an extra ton of armour and a targeting computer, it is capable of taking a heavier pounding at close range and boasts superior accuracy at mid to long range. Aside from this it is functionally similar to it’s predecessor, retaining the medium laser and ppc loadout; though the PPC’s have been updated to ER versions and the old single heat sinks swapped for more efficient double heat sinks. Production has been brisk, with General Motors taking orders from across the Inner Sphere and the Periphery; as mercenaries and planetary militias look to upgrade the older Marauders in their arsenals.",
