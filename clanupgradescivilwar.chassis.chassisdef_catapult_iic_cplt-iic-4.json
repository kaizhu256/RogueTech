The base of the 3 is an IS Catapult taken as isorla by the Adders during the Great Refusal and rebuilt to Clan standards. The inclusion of the Heavy Medium Lasers was a concession demanded by the Adders in exchange for the supply of the Catapults. Conceived as an experimental testbed for the ATM's, the 3 only had a limited production run. Combat testing revealed it to be an effective brawler and multirange missile platform; complementing older IIC and second line designs. Mostly fielded by the Coyotes, who retain the original production run; the Adders also field a small number of field conversions that are more or less identical to the design.",
