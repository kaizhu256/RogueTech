        "Details": "Thiago never set foot in an actual military academy, and he's proud of that fact. He'd hitched a ride as a boy with a rough-and-tumble outfit that'd come in to protect the mining outpost where he was born, and where his parent died. He doesn't seem too broken up about it; his mother was a drunk and his dad was a gambler, and between ol' pops wasting what little money they had left on dicing in the alleyways after his ma drank most of it up, he figures the pirates did him a solid. He'd started in the mess, washing dishes, and as a gofer for the crew. He tried learning from the techs, from the pilots, from the officers... anyone who'd give him a lesson. He had no designs on peeling potatoes and fetching bad coffee for the rest of his life.\r\n\r\nAs he grew up he learned about 'Mech combat, and it took a lot longer for him to get behind the wheel, so to speak, than it did for him to grasp the basics of tactics and strategy, since the latter didn't involve any risks to the outfit's hardware.  His callsign, Rhino, is a bit of an in-joke. Turns out just because he's built like one doesn't mean he's anywhere as tough as one. Bit of a glass jaw. Not that you'd want to let a tactical mind like his get bounced around in his skull in a bar fight, mind.",
