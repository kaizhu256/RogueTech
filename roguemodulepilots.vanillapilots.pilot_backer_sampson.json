        "Details": "One of the many children orphaned by the Third Succession War, Jeffrey Scott was lucky enough to be adopted by the noble Scott family of the Free Worlds League, and raised as a cherished member of their large family.\r\n\r\nAfter being educated at a local military academy, his family arranged for him to work at a military testing range instead of on the front lines. Not an uncommon act at the time, he still welcomed the opportunity to broaden the MechWarrior skills he'd acquired during school sports.\r\n\r\nWhat could have been a splendid career was severely curtained when he discovered that one of his siblings had been using him as a catspaw in a criminal endeavor with the potential to destabilize a Duchy. Rather than be indicted and betray his foolish brother, he abandoned his position.\r\n\r\nNow he travels the Periphery, taking work as a mercenary. Perhaps he'll make it home again. Perhaps not. Most of his stories of old days are of the Shadow Hawk he piloted on the test range, and if he'll ever see it again.",
