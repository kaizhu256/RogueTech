        "Details": "Nobles are born with silver spoons in their mouths. Toni Okoye was born with a wrench. Raised in the Outback of the Federated Suns, she learned quickly that one man’s junk was another man’s treasure. Parts and supply could be hard to find in the wilder parts of the Suns, and so many learned to re-jigger, reuse, and recycle. Toni enjoyed tinkering with all manner of devices, and her family had an oddly rich history in technology. Her grandfather had worked building Nissan 200s for the Enforcer, and he took that knowledge with them when the lot of them were forced to move after he lost his job at the fusion engine plant. Unfortunately he passed on in transit to their new home, but the Okoyes kept all his manuals and notes, and Toni’s mother and father both took jobs in repair and maintenance once the family re-settled.\r\n\r\nToni learned about ‘Mechs the same way a lot of people in the rougher parts of the Inner Sphere do; she got lucky. The garrison on her world had a chassis in need of an engine, and as it happened, Toni managed to blunder into one, get it working, and install it into the decrepit Enforcer 4R, giving the ‘Mech it’s first hum of life in a hundred years. A thankful local government let her train in it under the Dispossessed Mechwarrior they'd hired to pilot it for the militia, and before long the dream of being a real Mechwarrior took root. It didn’t help that the Mechwarrior Toni was learning from filled her head with stories of battles and victory, and it wasn’t long before she decided to market herself to any Mercenary company passing through as a two-for-one Tech and pilot deal; after all, and the budget-conscious might appreciate an extra hand in the Mechbay. However solid her skills with a wrench are, the aesthetics of her work often leave something to be desired, and it’s not uncommon for the Chief Tech of her outfit to wonder why the leg of the CO's ride looks like it lost a fight with a junkpile.",
