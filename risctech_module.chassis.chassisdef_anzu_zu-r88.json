Although the Anzu's maximum ground speed was 64 kph, the Chilton 465 Jump Jets allowed the Anzu to jump up to 120 meters. The Anzu mounted eleven tons of Starshield A Standard Armor with CASE II built in to protect the 'Mech and its pilot from ammunition explosions. The Anzu also used the same life support systems as the Shadow Hawk, already well-proven by the time the Anzu entered service, and the RCA Instatrac Mark X targeting and tracking system allowed the Anzu to simultaneously engage multiple targets while also spotting for indirect fire through the installed TAG system.",
