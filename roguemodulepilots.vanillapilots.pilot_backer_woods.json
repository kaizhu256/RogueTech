        "Details": "Michael Woods was born to a middle-class family in the Federated Suns. He grew up loyal to House Davion, as every child did. He even attended the Robinson Battle Academy, where his loyalty to House Davion was complemented by indoctrination with the hatred for the Draconis Combine so common in Robinson graduates. But he was never able to graduate from Robinson Battle Academy. During a live fire examination conducted though a punitive raid on Delacruz, Michael was deep behind enemy lines on a reconnaissance mission when recall orders came in from central command. So far from the landing zone and unable to arrive safely before liftoff, he was abandoned and left for dead. Fleeing deep into the forested wilderness, he left his assigned mech, a battered old SDR-5V Spider, under a makeshift shelter. He adopted a local name to help to hide his identity, and masqueraded as a member of the unproductive class until he could secure transport off-world. \r\n\r\nAt first, he expected all the horror stories fed to him about the Combine to be the truth, but quickly learned that not only had much of what he'd been taught had been a gross vilification, but numerous atrocities that pushed the boundaries of the Ares Conventions that his own forces had committed were never spoken of. He also began to suspect that he was intentionally abandoned on world by his COs for being of civilian blood. Selling his services as an unlicensed mercenary to the Delacruz yakuza oyabun, and eventually to other private concerns, he quickly gained a reputation for skill in reconnaissance and guerrilla campaigns. Now, though he has moved far beyond the combine-suns border, he hopes to one day strike back at his former COs who left him for dead.",
