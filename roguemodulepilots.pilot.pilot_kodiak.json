        "Details": "Kodiak was always a studious sort, learning about all the famous Solaris fighters for centuries and where they and their 'Mechs came from. His research led him into the sights of Interstellar Expeditions, who had realised his knowledge of maps and technology stockpiles from different databanks did not align with their own. During the brief foray working for IE, Kodiak added in much knowledge that was collated from numerous sources into the planetary database of the Inner Sphere and Periphery leading to numerous updates to navigational databases across known space.\r\n\r\nBecoming moderately wealthy due to the commission from IE, he then received passage to the Princefield Military Academy where he studied the remaining training 'Mechs that existed there, and learned to pilot these ancient behemoths. After graduation, the cartography royalties have kept him in a comfortable but extremely boring lifestyle, thus leading him into mercenary work. Seeking an outfit using unusual 'Mechs, Kodiak is known for being a steadfast pilot but definitely has the potential to bore other Mechwarriors with tales of far off worlds!",
