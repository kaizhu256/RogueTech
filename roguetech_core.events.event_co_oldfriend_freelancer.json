As Darius escorts them to the Barracks, they stare in awe at the <i>Argo</i>.\r\n\r\nOver the course of the next couple weeks, Darius works closely with Douglass on lining up his next contract. Meanwhile, his crew gets to know the <i>Argo</i>'s MechWarriors, and the two groups are soon sharing stories from around the Periphery. \r\n\r\nWhen Douglass returns to the <i>Argo</i>, he's visibly more relaxed than when he arrived. \"Your XO was amazing. I'll send you a share of the payment when we're done. It's the least I can do!\"",
