A cheap upgrade, this is a favourite of pilots who were previously assigned a 68; with many praising the enhanced range and accuracy of the Laser. Paired into demi lances, and assigned a C3 Master equipped mech to coordinate, these Mongoose's are deployed as head hunters and long range harassers; both roles that make use of their high ground speed and manoeuvrability.
