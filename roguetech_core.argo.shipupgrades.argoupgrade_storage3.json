This includes equipment, weapons, salvaged 'Mechs and stored 'Mechs.</color></b> \n\n Automating the <i>Argo</i>'s internal storage is the future. One last upgrade to the storage cells would let us move to an automated drone inventory system with a few pressurised WorkMechs for special work. Depressurising some of our inventory and making robots do the work will save us a lot of upkeep by letting us assign the labour and resources elsewhere",
