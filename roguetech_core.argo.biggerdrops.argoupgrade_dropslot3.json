Several of the gyros and handling sensors around the ship are damaged or downright missing. If we try to insert the ship from orbit with anything less than an absolutely perfectly balanced load, there's a very real chance we could lose the shuttle and all aboard. We'll need to replace and recalibrate those systems through some test drops before we can make full use of the new Leopard, Commander.",
