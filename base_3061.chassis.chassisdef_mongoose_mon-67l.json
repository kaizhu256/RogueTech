Assigned to the First and Second Long Road Legions, every part of the mech is manufactured in the Alliance, save for the imported TAG system. The Alliance Military Corps provides the Mongoose chassis from their reserve stocks of Mon-67 models. The original medium lasers are swapped for 3 of the Alliances new ER Medium lasers and the small laser is removed altogether. The addition of locally produced Ferro-Fibrous armour allows for a minor gain in protection and the addition of the TAG system. Developed as a fast harasser and spotter, designed to work in concert with the Alliance Air Wings and Planetary garrisons; the design has proven popular among Mongoose pilots as much for it's improved capabilities as it's locally made parts.
