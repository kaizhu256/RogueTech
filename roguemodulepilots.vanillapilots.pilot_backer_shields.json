        "Details": "There's only one path for a war orphan raised in a group home in a nation where the same war yet rages. Bjorn Hummel, of the Lyran Commonwealth, joined the LCAF as soon as he was of age, alongside many of his foster siblings.\r\n\r\nTheir group home had been a good one, and he and his foster siblings kept in close contact after their different assignments. Until his promotion to special ops, he shared almost everything with them. After, his letters closed down, and he saw the same slow withdrawal from them as the war pulled them away from each other. Eventually, for too many of them, he'd get one final letter about them, from the person who'd raised them, informing him of their death. And once, through shady means, he received a letter full of secrets, sent by a foster brother who subsequently died.\r\n\r\nThese weren't secrets to shake a nation, or destroy a company. Not in a galaxy at war. But they were secrets to shatter a soul, and they came too close to some of Bjorn's own experiences for him to lock away. A year of poor sleep rendered him unfit for duty, and he was discharged from the LCAF.\r\n\r\nThe nightmares eased a little, then. But he soon found the only way he could really sleep at night was if he was engaged in a cause he could really believe in. He's picky about his contracts, now. He's going to make things better.",
