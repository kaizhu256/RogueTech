        "Details": "Draconis Combine's 3K was an upgrade of the 1A9 that used an uprated XL engine to raise the Charger's top speed back to 86.4 km/h. The head-mounted small laser was removed, the medium lasers were swapped out for Medium Pulse Lasers, and the LRM-20 launcher was mated with an Artemis IV fire control system to improve accuracy. The addition of a fifth jump jet mounted in the rear torso gave the 'Mech a jumping distance of up to one hundred and fifty meters. This variant was confirmed to have been deployed on An Ting in the War of 3039 and may have been what Davion forces initially dubbed the Charger II; however, descriptions of the Charger II suggest that it was more likely a LRM-equipped variant of the Hatamoto-Chi (presumably the -Kaze).",
