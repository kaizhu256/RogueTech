The chassis was upgraded to an Earthwerks STG II Endo Steel model, allowing it to carry an additional half-ton of armor. The 'Mech retained the Omicron medium laser but swapped the machine guns for a Lindblad Shotgun Anti-Missile System on its right arm and a Flame Tech Flamer on its left. One ton of AMS ammo was carried in the right torso, while the Datacom 26 and Dynatec 990 electronic systems remain unchanged.",
