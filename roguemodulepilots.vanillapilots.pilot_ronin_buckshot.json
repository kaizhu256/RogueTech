They were one of many children of an industrial 'Mech pilot and her technician, on a hot, desolate wasteland only valuable for the poison it harbors under the surface.\r\n\r\nPage grew up constantly aware of the omnipresence of doom. It was unavoidable, but out of familial respect, Page made at least a token effort and thus made it to adulthood. Then, having already lost two siblings to the mines of Ryans Fate, they carefully weighed the risks and decided that, out of familial respect, piloting a mercenary BattleMech would be safer than staying at home.",
