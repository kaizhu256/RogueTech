Noting the loss of many Arrow IV equipped units and the slaughter of their crews during Clan breakthroughs, the Maverick Industries design teams looked for ways to improve the situation. With a license to produce the Hollander BZK-F3 already secured, it was decided to produce an upgraded model that utilised an XL Engine to mount the Arrow IV launcher. Modern artillery tactics called for the deployment of anti air and anti mech units to protect the precious assets, so Maverick only mounted a Small Pulse Laser on the mech, augmented by a TAG; so that the Hollander could handle infantry infiltrators and spot for either it’s own launcher or the rest of it’s lancemates. The designs speed was judged sufficient for it to evade other threats that might threaten the mech, especially with it’s armour unable to stand up to much punishment. ",
