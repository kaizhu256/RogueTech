I think I can get ¢75,000, give or take. The other is offering machine tools in trade, which the Mech Bay could use to boost productivity.\"\r\n\r\nDarius looks longingly at his basket. \"All offers require a minimum supply of produce, though, and it'll take more than our surplus to fill them. The crew won't like limits on their salad bar.\"",
