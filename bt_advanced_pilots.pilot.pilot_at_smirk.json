        "Details": "Tariq grew up knowing he wanted to serve in the LCAF as a Mechwarrior. He would skip school to sneak off and spend time with his mother who worked at Coventry Metal Works to be around the Battlemechs. He would stay up nights, looking at blueprints, studying how myomer works, or building models of his favorite machines. He had a particular fondness for the Hunchback; the massive autocannon put a twinkle in his eyes.\r\n\r\nThanks to his connections, he was able to attend the Conventry Military Academy, and was enrolled in the Reconnaissance program when the Jade Falcons invaded Steiner space. He was there when they attacked Coventry. He fought alongside his training cadre as the Clanners tried to take his home planet. And he, like the rest of his comrades, failed in its defense. He was captured, and taken as bondsman by the Falcons. When they departed, he was released, but his time in detention left a mark on Tariq. Instead of participating in the rebuilding of the academy, he instead left Lyran space, beleiving his training had not been enough. He felt he needed real experience in a place where people didn't fight by the book. So he sought passage to the Periphery and a commission in a mercenary unit.\r\n\r\nTariq is a friendly guy, always wearing a sideways smile, hence his handle. He's relaxed and approachable, but he's fierce in his commitment to return to Conventry and participate in the fight. With the Civil War inflaming between the Lyrans and FedSuns though, he's content to remain in mercenary employ for the time being. He might grimace at taking a Davion contract, and he makes no bones about the fact that he will leave one day to return home, but for now he's a dedicated, loyal soldier.",
