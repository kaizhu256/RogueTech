        "Details": "Hannah Yamashita hails from the Draconis Combine, and it shows. She expresses that very Japanese tendency towards perfection in all that she does, from pruning the bonsai she keeps in her very orderly quarters, to negotiating narrow alleyways and streets in her preferred Battlemech, the Firestarter. She has a penchant for urban combat, Light ‘Mechs, and anti-infantry operations, and when given the opportunity, gladly partakes in all three. She also has the habit of writing haikus on the side of her ‘Mech after each engagement; beautiful little poems describing and entire conflict in three simple lines.  And many of her mechs have read like compilations.\r\n\r\nSomething troubling seems to follow her, however; she has a mien like a black cat, and she often makes the more superstitious of her colleagues uneasy. It’s hard to say why, but it could be the smile she wears after a particularly eventful day stalking the city, rooting out entrenched opposition.",
