Armed with a Howitzer in place of the iconic Sniper piece, it lacks the range and stopping power of the later versions, whilst running significantly hotter due to the second large laser it mounted. Only a couple of test models were every introduced and the design was lost to the mists of history with the debut of the 1H and then the 2H, in 2480.
