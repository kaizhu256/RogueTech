The 180 meter jump capability is also useful, allowing the pilot to get out of tight terrain very quickly. The upgraded armor protection is valued by those warriors used to the older Stinger as well, but this armor is still too light to allow the 'Mech to operate in a stand up fight. This variant is unique in that it's intended for vacuum operations by Clan Snow Raven. The mech also utilizes Laser Heat Sinks to keep the Stinger IIC cool.",
