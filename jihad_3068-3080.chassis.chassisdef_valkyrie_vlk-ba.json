Lacking the means to manufacture or reverse engineer the Stealth armour, Corean Enterprises only produced a few production runs of this mech. More a series of modifications to their successful QD design, than a new mech; the design is nonetheless distinctive in its own right. The first stealth mech produced by their New Avalon facility, it relies on a combination of speed and manoeuvrability to survive in combat. A pair of X-Pulse Lasers provide blistering fire power at short range, while an MML-5 with a variety of munitions is capable of providing long range support or direct fire capabilities.
