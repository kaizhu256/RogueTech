        "Details": "Reginald von Kaas was born and bred on Terra, the only child of ComStar demi-precentors. He grew up schooled in all the traditions and when he was of age, he joined the local defense force.\r\n\r\nAfter some formal training, he was assigned to supervise BattleMech restoration, where he fell in love with the machines. Using his family connections, he had himself reassigned as a 'Mech pilot. He then proceeded to show such dedication to the use and care of 'Mechs that he was quickly promoted to the top of his local defense cadre despite the lack of combat opportunities.\r\n\r\nAfter that, there's a blank spot in his record, the sort typical of those who have engaged in covert operations. He dropped out of sight for over five years. His next official record is in the Periphery on the MRB register, using the callsign VonKobra and with several impressive shooting certifications under his belt.\r\n\r\nAccording to those records, at one time he led a small mercenary unit of his own, but that unit dissolved without any recorded contracts. He now considers himself a freelance operative, although his personal intensity suggests the 'freelance' descriptor may be deceptive.",
