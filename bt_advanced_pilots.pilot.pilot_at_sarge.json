        "Details": "One of the worst things an otherwise dedicated, professional human being has to do is live as a hypocrite, and Amelia Bianchi knows exactly how that feels. She spent a large portion of her House military career pushing people forward and driving them to be their best. Do that extra pull-up. Run that extra lap. Tighten that shot cluster. Don't quit.\r\n\r\nSarge, as she was affectionately known, chose to do just that. She quit. She patently refused to participate in the brewing Civil War between the Lyrans and her home state the Federated Suns, citing that, quote: 'It's f**ing stupid is what it is'. So instead of participate; instead of being the patriot she always tried to make her cadets into, she turned her back and left. She resigned her commission, and headed rimward in disgrace as the quitter she never meant anyone to be. And now she has to live with that out on the fringe, contracting with mercenaries and hoping nobody back home thinks so poorly of her as to ignore the lessons she taught them. Being in exile is no excuse for slacking though, as she says, and so she'll push her current crew to run that extra lap, or do that extra pull-up. Because if there's going to be any quitter in the room, it'll only ever be her.",
