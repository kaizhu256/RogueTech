        "Details": "Brett Finnegan Bozeman was born to minor nobility on Gulkana in the Federated Suns, but moved early with his family to Maldive near the Taurian Concordant as part of a business consolidation. There he received a comprehensive education in physical and intellectual pursuits from personal tutors.\r\n\r\nAs he grew, he witnessed the tumultuous handling of the planetary government by the local governing corporation, and resisted family pressure to take his place in the family business; he wanted no part of such an undisciplined and untrustworthy environment. Instead, he enlisted in the AFFS as soon as he was of age.\r\n\r\nShortly after his enlistment, his record was blanked. His family lost contact with him, except for the occasional update from his superior offices reassuring them he was still alive. When peace loomed in the 3020s, he finally resurfaced, a hardened MechWarrior unwilling -- or unable -- to talk about what he'd been doing for so many years.\r\n\r\nAfter a year of peace with his family on New Avalon, he could no longer take the quiet life. While he was not allowed to return to active duty in the AFFS, they couldn't stop him from seeking out mercenary work on the Periphery. This time, though, he promised to keep his family updated on his movements.",
