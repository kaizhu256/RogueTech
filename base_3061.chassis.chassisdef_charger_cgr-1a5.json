        "Details": "The 1A5 variant of the Charger was one of the first variants of the Charger made to take it from the role of scout to assault 'Mech. A Capellan modification to the CGR-1Ls they received as part of the Kapteyn Accords, the engine was downgraded to a 320 version, which reduced the maximum speed of the 'Mech to 64.8 km/h, and four of the small lasers were removed. In their place was a Tomodzuru Autocannon/20 as its primary weapon, two Bical SRM-6 launchers and an Argra 3L Medium Laser, while the 'Mech's armor was increased by five tons. This made the CGR-1A5 extremely dangerous at close ranges and gave it a speed comparable to most 'Mechs in the heavy weight class, while carrying armor on par with other eighty-ton 'Mechs.",
