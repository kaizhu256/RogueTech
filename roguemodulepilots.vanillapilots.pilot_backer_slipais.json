        "Details": "The son of military reservists in the Federated Suns, Aidan Slipais decided to step up the family commitment to military action by attending one of the military academies. Aptitude testing there declared him to be a good fit for special ops, so when he graduated from the Academy, he gave it a try.\r\n\r\nHis superior officers found very little to complain about, but in the old fairytale parlance, Aidan himself found it 'too hot'. So on his next tour, he opted to join a regular unit, to see if he enjoyed the more relaxing pace of overt warfare more.\r\n\r\nHe found his special ops experience quite useful in commanding his unit, and once again, his commanding officers had nothing but praise for his performance. Alas for the Armed Forces of the Federated Suns, he found it 'too cold'.\r\n\r\nSo, in search of something that would get his blood pumping but not make his hair stand on end, he retired from military service and traveled to Solaris VII. He joined a stable, participated in some bouts, and found a new stage in an old story: 'too expensive.'\r\n\r\nNow, he works as a mercenary in the Periphery. It isn't the military career he dreamed of as a child, but for now, it's 'just right,' the perfect mix of excitement and downtime in an all-expenses-paid environment.",
