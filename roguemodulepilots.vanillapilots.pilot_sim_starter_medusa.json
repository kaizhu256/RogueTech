There he attended a local technical school to augment the knowledge heÔÇÖd picked up while growing up. He spent some time working as a tech on his parents' IndustrialMechs. Eventually, craving more excitement, he hitched a ride on a mercenary DropShip, where he soon talked his way into a BattleMech cockpit. He's never looked back.",
