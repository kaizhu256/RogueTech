        "Details": "Born to engineers on Victoria in the Capellan Confederation, Chris Eck was marked early as a particularly gifted child. Matching early performance was rewarded with the patronage required for him to attend the Sian Center for Martial Disciplines. He graduated in the top fifth percentile and was immediately recommended for the Sian University Officer Candidate Program.\r\n\r\nAfter he passed the strenuous final examination process, he was assigned to a BattleMech unit in a lieutenant position. He served in that position for several years, but when he was due for promotion, he was instead invited back to the SCMD for advanced courses in the specialized field of BattleMech covert operations. After some time engaged in \"boring activities nobody would want to hear about\", he was sent to Solaris VII for the traditional MechWarrior background cleansing. There, he made an unexpected splash by going undefeated in his first tournament, despite joining late and without the backing of a stable.\r\n\r\nNow in the Periphery, he tells his story easily over a couple of beers, with every indication of perfect honesty. When awed rookies ask how he ended up working out in the Periphery as a mercenary, his only answer is, \"I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you.\" He isn't lying.",
