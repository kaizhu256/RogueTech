        "Details": "The variant of the Banshee was created by the Word of Blake after they took over Hesperus II in 3070. It turns the 'Mech into a brawler with the inclusion of Triple Strength Myomer and a Hatchet. It returns to the XL Engine of the 5S and keeps the ubiquitous Small Laser. The LB-X Autocannon/10 is retained from the 6S, though it moves to the other side. An ER Large Laser is added for use at long range and a Snub-Nose PPC is effective at medium range, though it is more damaging up close. An XL Gyro frees up tonnage for four medium lasers, two standard and two extended range models, as well an ER Small Laser. The inclusion of only thirteen double heat sinks ensures that the myomer activates easily. A C3 Slave Unit allows the 8S to share targeting telemetry, though the fact that it is not one of the Word's improved versions suggests that this 'Mech is not intended for use by Word of Blake Militia, but rather their mercenaries or even important planetary garrisons. Finally, eighteen tons of armor and a Guardian ECM Suite radically improve the defenses of the venerable Banshee.",
